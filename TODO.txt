### TODO / Future improvements

1. Error handling and user experience

Centralize exception handling and ensure all unhandled exceptions are consistently visualized at the UI level.

Replace raw error states with user-friendly messages and clear recovery paths.

Review exception behavior during page initialization and data loading phases.

2. Loading and page state management

Improve page lifecycle handling while data is loading (IsLoading state situations).

Prevent situations where a page remains stuck in a loading state due to failed requests or exceptions.

Add fallback UI states (error / empty / retry) for all data-driven pages.

3. Email confirmation flow

Add Resend Confirmation Email functionality.

Expose a dedicated button or link on the Login page for users with unconfirmed email addresses.

Ensure the resend flow works both with the current local setup and with a future email provider.

4. User lifecycle consistency

Review and harden interactions between existing, deleted, and partially configured users.

Ensure that deleting a user does not leave orphaned data or inconsistent business state.

Define clear rules for handling users with business roles (Teacher / Student) during deletion.

5. Security hardening before production use

Move sensitive configuration (connection strings, admin seed credentials) out of appsettings.json:

Use environment variables or a secure secrets provider.

Rework admin seeding logic:

Avoid hardcoded credentials.

Limit automatic admin creation to development scenarios only.

Review authentication, authorization, and data access boundaries before enabling public deployment.
